Effectively Using eMacs with python

First, install the latest version of eMacs:  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining

Then, download Emacs for Python: (http://gabrielelanaro.github.io/emacs-for-python/).  Make sure to read through this and follow the instructions.

To find or create your .emacs file, type the following keystrokes with eMacs running in the foreground to invoke eMac's "Find File" command: C-c C-f
-  Then type .emacs
